  I am a 4th year PhD student at Drexel University (expected graduation June 2024), in the Quantitative Psychology and Statistics Laboratory. My research explores application of statistical modeling (e.g., Machine Learning, Mixed effects) for analysis of Alzheimer's disease-related neuroimaging data.

            Current Dissertation research concerns the evaluation of putative Alzheimer's disease subtypes.
            
            Master's thesis evaluated the prediction of Alzheimer's disease patient 'brain age' as a biomarker for disease progression using longitudinal, multimodal neuroimaging features (e.g., MRI, PET). Results were published in _NeuroImage_ (2023).
